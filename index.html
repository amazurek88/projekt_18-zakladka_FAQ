                <p class="accordion-content">Yes. According to the regulations, two or more people checking in at the same time may combine the weight of their baggage while maintaining the maximum weight for a single item of baggage, which is 32 kg (OWP Art. 18). It is worth remembering that the combined baggage must have the same maximum dimensions as standard baggage, i.e. 120 x 80 x 100.</p>

                <p class="accordion-content">We always recommend that you transport medication in your hand luggage (in case your checked baggage is delayed). Medicines should be transported in their original packaging along with the manufacturer's leaflet (to facilitate security checks). Liquid medications may be transported in packages larger than 100 ml, provided that they are necessary during the journey. Cabin crew cannot keep medicines in a cool place.</p>

                <p class="accordion-content">Yes. However, for transport it is necessary to obtain the consent of the carrier. Additionally, we only accept dogs and cats for transport (OWP art. 19). According to the regulations (OWP art. 19), the transport of animals takes place only on board the plane, therefore only animals weighing up to 8 kg with a cage and with specified maximum dimensions (OWP 19) are allowed. The transport of animals takes place after an additional payment (OWP 19), with the exception of Art. 19. According to the carrier's instructions, the animal should be taken for a walk before check-in. A few hours before the cruise, water and food intake should be kept to a minimum. During its journey, the animal may not be taken out of the cage. The transport of the animal is possible only on the basis of the required documents (passport with confirmation of the required vaccinations). It is the passenger's responsibility to meet the formal requirements for the veterinary documentation of the animal in the countries of arrival and departure.</p>
